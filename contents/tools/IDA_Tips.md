#### *<p align='center'> Addresses Shown In IDA </p>*
---
* When IDA loads a binary, it simulates a mapping of the file in memory. The addresses shown in IDA are the virtual memory addresses and not offsets of the binary file on disk

#### *<p align='center'> Import Address Table (IAT) </p>*
---
* IAT shows you all the dynamically linked libraries' functions that the binary uses. IAT is important for a reverser to understand how the binary will be interacting with the OS. To hide API calls from displaying in the IAT, a programmer can dynamically resolve them
* __How To Find Dynamically Resolved APIs__: get the binary's function trace (e.g. hybrid-analysis, ltrace). If any of the APIs in the function trace is not in the IAT, then that API is dynamically resolved
* __How To Find Where A Dynamically Resolved API Is Called__: in IDA's debugger view, the Module Windows allows you to place a breakpoint on any function in a loaded dynamically linked library. Use it to place a breakpoint on a dynamically resolved API and once execution breaks there, step back through the call stack to find where it's called from in user code

#### *<p align='center'> Graphs </p>*
---
* All the available graphs (beside 'proximity browser') can be found in 'View' -> 'Graphs'
  * Proximity browser can be found in 'View' -> 'Open subviews'
* When we hear IDA Graphs, most of us first thought of 'Graph View', which shows how basic blocks of the function the mouse cursor is on relate to each other, but IDA also provides many other graphs that helps us understand how functions in the binary relate to each other. The former helps us understand how a function works while the latter helps us understand how the program works. We will take a look at those other graphs below

#### *<p align='center'> Useful Shortcuts </p>*
---
* __u__ to undefine 
* __d__ to turn it to data 
* __c__ to turn it to code 
* __g__ to bring up the jump to address menu
* __n__ to rename
* __x__ to show cross-references
